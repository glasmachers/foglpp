## Frede's OpenGl C++ wrapper library

### About

This is a wrapper library which provides wrapper classes for OpenGL objects.

It is designed to be as low level as possible while providing RAII for as many objects as possible.

It should be useable with any OpenGL implementation which is compatible with GLES 2.0. At least it is usable on the raspberry pi.

It is a header only library.
